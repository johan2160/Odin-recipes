    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>For the Pino</strong> always prepare it the day before, In a large saucepan, heat the oil and fry the meat until lightly browned about 8 minutes. Add the paprika, salt, pepper, and cumin, and saute for a few minutes. Add the broth and simmer for 30 minutes over low heat. Add the onion, mix well, and cook over medium heat until the onion is tender, about 30 minutes. Add the flour and stir well and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Cook two more minutes. Cool and refrigerate.</li>
            <li><strong>For the dough</strong>. Make a brine with the milk, water, and salt, and stir to dissolve the salt. Mix the flour and eggs in a large bowl or a stand mixer with the paddle attachment and mix for a minute to incorporate. Add the melted shortening and work a little more. At this point, you will see only crumbs. To form the dough start adding the brine with the mixer running on low speed until the dough is soft and flexible. If needed, keep adding water. Separate the dough into 20 portions and cover with a moist cloth. Work each piece individually, rolling until thin, cut in a circle about 7â€³ and fill with two tablespoons of Pino, a quarter of a hard-boiled egg, olives, and raisins if desired. Close by smearing the edge, pressing firmly, and making the folds. Brush with an egg wash before baking.
